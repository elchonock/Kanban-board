Set your first task [here](https://elchonock.github.io/KanbanBoardPages/).        
You can add new tasks with "+Add" button or just dblclick empty area in a column.          
To delete: click the button in top right corner of an item.                                    
Move items between columns.                     
All changes saves in localStorage.
